Technical Report: Excel Calendar Automation 

1. Overview
This Excel VBA project automates calendar population based on dynamic inputs from specified columns (Z, AE, AH). It triggers updates when changes occur in columns S, T, U, or V, populating predefined ranges on the "2025" sheet with names and colors while adhering to boundary constraints.
2. Key Features
Event-Driven Automation: Uses Worksheet_Change to auto-run when data in trigger columns (S, T, U, V) is modified.
Dynamic Cell Population:
Reads names from column Z and start/end cell addresses from AE/AH.
Fills cells from start to end address with the name and assigns a unique color per person.
Boundary Handling: Skips predefined boundary ranges (e.g., Q3:Q6) and jumps 5 rows down in column B.
Color Coding: Uses a dictionary to track and reuse colors for consistency.
3. Technical Details
Sheets: Requires a sheet named "2025" with predefined ranges for clearing/formatting.
Dependencies:
Columns Z (name), AE (start cell), AH (end cell) must be populated.
Boundary ranges are hardcoded (e.g., Q3:Q6, R8:R11).
4. Usage
Populate columns Z, AE, AH with valid data.
Modify cells in columns S, T, U, or V to trigger updates.
Calendar ranges are auto-cleared and repopulated.
5. Conclusion
This project efficiently automates calendar population with minimal user intervention, leveraging VBA for dynamic data handling and visual organization. Enhancements could improve robustness and usability.
